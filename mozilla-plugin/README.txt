current project status

new build of the mozilla control plugin and new installation with current Gecko Engine

bugs:
mozilla control crashs the IE on closing on instance or on creating two instances parallel
text wrapper function is Firefox specific and not included in the Gecko Engine


Summary:
Causing the abandoned status of the mozilla control, which sources are untouched since 2005,
no further improvement can be expected.

= Who should read this? =
This guide should be interesting for administrators of Oryx applications, but NOT for developers. All developers and users that want to customize their installation beyond the configuration options explained below may read the [http://code.google.com/p/oryx-editor/wiki/InstallUpdateConfigureProductiveSystems developer guide].

In case you're experiencing any problems, feel free to contact us by mail or join our discussion group.

= Introduction =

The Oryx application can be installed on all systems that support Java, Python 2.5 and PostgreSQL 8.3. We've tested installations successfully on Windows Server 2003 and Debian (Lenny) operating systems. Although it's also possible to use Mac OS X, Windows Vista, Windows XP, Ubuntu and other desktop operating systems we recommend to use server sytems in productive environments.

#labels Featured

= Introduction =

Oryx Editor is a web application that is designed to run well in Firefox, beginning with version 2.0. Most of the application is written in JavaScript, a tiny server module is written in PHP. In addition to that, you will need to get familiar with SVG and JSON to design or edit additional stencil sets.

= Set Up =

You are recommended to use Eclipse for Oryx Editor development. Plugins you should use include the Aptana IDE and Subclipse. You will have to set up Ant on your system, and you might want to set up an Apache web server. You will need to use Firefox for viewing.

== Development Environment ==

You will need a JavaScript development environment to start Oryx Editor development. You may prefer a simple text editor or one that has special support for JavaScript. However, we recommend you get yourself the [http://www.aptana.com/ Aptana IDE], which has served the original development team well. This instructions will guide you to a working setup as an Eclipse plugin:
  # [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Download] and extract/install Eclipse 3.2. You may prefer the 'Classic' distribution. When using a newer version of Eclipse, check for Aptana IDE compatibility.
  # Start Eclipse.
  # With the help of the integrated Software Update mechanism, install the plugins from the following update site URL: {{{http://update.aptana.com/install/3.2/}}}. Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found [http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Plugging_Aptana_into_an_existing_Eclipse_configuration here].
  # You will have to restart Eclipse.
  # Unless your Elipse version has integrated support for SVN, install it from the update site URL {{{http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x}}} using the same mechanism.
  # Again, you will have to restart Eclipse.
  # Make sure you have an Oryx Editor compatible version of Firefox on your system. If there is none, [http://www.mozilla.com/ download] and install version 2.0.

== Checkout and Build ==

Descriptions on how to checkout the Oryx Editor will follow. Once you have a local copy of the Oryx source files, use these instructions to build:
  # Back in Eclipse, make sure it supports Ant.
  # Use External Tools to register a new ant build. Choose build.xml in your trunk root to be the buildfile.
  # Switch to targets and select clean, build, compress, all. Maintain this order.
  # Run the build.
Oryx will be built into the build directory of your workspace. You may need to refresh the view.

== Run ==

Open {{{./build/editor.xhtml}}} in Firefox to run Oryx Editor with the BPMN stencil set.

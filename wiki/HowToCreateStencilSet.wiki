#summary How to create a stencil set for oryx by the example of Let's Dance

= Introduction =

A typical stencil set consists of a JSON file and several SVG files, as well as several 
picture files. The JSON file contains the stencil set description, e.g. a definition 
of every stencil.

For each stencil in a stencil set one SVG file that contains the graphical representation of the stencil and one picture file that is used 
as an icon for that stencil is required.

These files are stored in a specific folder structure like the 

	letsdance
	   |- letsdance.json
	   |- icons 
	   |- view

= Creating Graphical Representation =

The first step create the SVG files for the graphical representation of the Let's dance" modeling language and store them in the view folder.

When using oryx elements and attributes in a SVG document, you have to set a prefix. In this example the prefix "oryx" is used.

{{{
<svg
   xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
   xmlns:oryx="http://www.b3mn.org/oryx"
   version="1.1">
	...
</svg>
}}}

To start modeling, a kind of background paper is needed. On it you can place interaction and relationship objects. 
The file node.diagram.svg only consists of a square with a stroke and fill color. It is done by adding a "rect" element to the "g" element:

{{{
{
	"title":"Let's Dance",
	"namespace":"http://b3mn.org/stencilset/letsdance#",
	"description":"Simple stencil set for Let's Dance diagrams.",
	 "stencils": [/*..*/],
	 "rules":{*/..*/}
}
}}}

The description of the head node is added just by insertion of a new node element into the stencils section.

{{{
{
	"title":"Let's Dance",
	"namespace":"http://b3mn.org/stencilset/letsdance#",
	"description":"Simple stencil set for Let's Dance diagrams.",
	 "stencils": [
		{
			"type":		"node",
			"id":			"Diagram",
			"title":		"Diagram",	
			"groups":		["Diagram"],
			"description":	"A Let’s Dance Diagram",
			"view":		"node.diagram.svg",
			"icon":		"diagram.png",
			"roles":		[]
		   }
	],
	 "rules":{*/..*/}
}
}}}

Finally you have to edit the editor.xhtml. There it is necessary to tell oryx to use the Let’s Dance stencil set.

First add a reference to the JSON file. For example like this:

{{{
<meta name="oryx.type" content="http://b3mn.org/stencilset/letsdance#Diagram" />
}}}

When open the editor.xhtml in Firefox, you should see a blank diagram background.

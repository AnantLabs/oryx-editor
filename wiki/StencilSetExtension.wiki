#summary Requirements for Stencil Set extension

= Introduction =

Although the current stencil set specification was good enough for implementing various stencil sets, there are some restrictions we now want to get rid of. The stencil set extension shall mainly ease the definition of stencil sets and introduce ways of extending existing stencil sets with properties.

= Requirements =

== Backwards Compatibility ==

The changes on the stencil set specification may not have an impact on existing stencil sets. Only very small adjustments that could be done for all existing stencil sets as part of this project are allowed.

== Property Packages ==

Currently, you have to define the properties for each stencil seperately. In case of BPMN this restriction blows the stencil set definition up to almost 6000 lines. But also in this case, all stencils share some general properties and each group of stencils (e.g. Intermediate Events) has even more properties in common. That is why I want to introduce property packages to define properties only once and then add 0..n property packages to a stencil. Of course, you can still add properties to a stencil directly.

== Property-dependant Properties ==

In case of BPMN Intermediate Events an event has different properties dependant on the value of the property _Trigger_.

== Extend existing Stencil Sets ==


== Stencil Set dependant Plugins ==


== Different Categories for Properties ==

_Issue #43_




== onChange onCreate Callback for Properties ==
The stencil set specification should support onChange methods that are
called whenever a stencil's property at runtime is changed.

Scenario (from let's dance stencil set):
There is a stencil with a text property name and a color property that sets
the stencil's background color. At runtime you have a stencil instance A
where you set the text to 'abc' and the color to purple. Then you create
another stencil instance B and also set the text to 'abc'. At this point,
the color of stencil B should be automatically set to A's color, because
they have the same text.
